# TypescriptSandbox
Boilerplate to setup a Typescript sandbox

## Installation
Clone or download the repositorie and run `npm install` in the directory

## Usage

Run your program's entry point in /src/main.ts

To build the program run `npm run build`. This will invoke webpack to oputput a single main.js file in /dist/

To run your program with node run `npm run start`. Beware that it runs webpack beforehand.

To run as a web application, host /dist/index.html in a development web server

Feel free to use this if you want a quick & dirty solution to test a class or an interaction of clases in design processes
